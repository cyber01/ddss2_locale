				""
				"This pack combines most of the tech, magic and adventure mods to make it feel like a complete game rather than a bunch of mods thrown together. The quest book is divided into 6 chapters that cover all the important topics and things you need to work your way through this progression system. This also applies to the different dimensions that gradually become important. Therefore, be aware that some mods, such as Blood Magic, can only be started at a certain tech-magic level."

				"Also keep in mind this is a hardcore adventure and expert quest-pack. Highly recommended to have at least a basic knowledge about modded minecraft and perhaps not the expectation of playing through this modpack in a week^^"
