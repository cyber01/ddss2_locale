First, we have the incredible opportunity to work with Immersive Petroleum multiblocks to create amazing products like Diesel and Sulfurized Diesel. Not only will these fuels improve the performance of generators, but they'll also produce High-Carbon-Petroleum Steel Ingots! Afterwards, we'll dive into the main part of the T3 machinery, accompanied by Bloodmagic's secrets and further unknown dimensions. This chapter is going to be absolutely thrilling! And as if that wasn't enough, we also built our first rocket to fly to the moon!"
